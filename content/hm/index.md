## Mr. Mulamogi Bashir – Head Teacher

Welcome to Fairways Primary School – Kireka, a distinguished Centre of academic excellence and character formation nestled in the heart of Uganda. At Fairways, we are committed to offering holistic and quality primary education that not only meets but exceeds national standards. Our pupils consistently excel in the Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE), achieving only first grades – a testament to our dedicated staff, effective teaching methodologies, and supportive learning environment.

Beyond academic performance, our curriculum is designed to nurture well-rounded individuals equipped with essential life skills. Pupils are actively trained in swimming, ball games, athletics, home economics, debate, and computer literacy. These activities not only enhance physical fitness and cognitive development but also promote teamwork, confidence, and critical thinking, skills necessary for future success in any field.

Our school embraces diversity and unity by being proudly multi-denominational. All faiths are given space and time to thrive, with one hour per week allocated for religious instruction. Furthermore, we host special spiritual milestones such as Holy Communion and Confirmation ceremonies right here at school. This commitment to spiritual development ensures that our learners grow in values, respect, and moral integrity.

At Fairways Primary School – Kireka, we believe that education should touch every aspect of a child's life. Our enriched curriculum blends academics with talent development, discipline with creativity, and faith with knowledge. We provide a safe, inclusive, and nurturing environment where every learner’s potential is discovered, celebrated, and sharpened for the betterment of society.

We would be honoured if you entrusted us with your child. Join the Fairways family and allow your son or daughter to experience a transformative journey marked by academic brilliance, personal growth, and a lifelong love for learning. Together, we can shape the leaders of tomorrow.
