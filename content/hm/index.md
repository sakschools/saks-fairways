## Mr. Mulamogi Bashir – Head Teacher

Welcome to Fairways Primary School – Kireka, a distinguished centre of academic excellence and character formation nestled in the heart of Uganda. At Fairways, we are committed to offering holistic and quality primary education that not only meets but exceeds national standards. Our pupils consistently excel in the Primary Leaving Examinations (PLE), achieving only first grades – a testament to our dedicated staff, effective teaching methodologies, and supportive learning environment.

Beyond academic performance, our curriculum is designed to nurture well-rounded individuals equipped with essential life skills. Pupils are actively trained in swimming, ball games, athletics, home economics, debate, and computer literacy. These activities not only enhance physical fitness and cognitive development but also promote teamwork, confidence, and critical thinking, skills necessary for future success in any field.

To support the formation of responsible, respectful, and morally upright individuals, Winston has instituted a structured Behaviour Building Programme. Through this initiative, pupils are guided in developing good manners, leadership qualities, empathy, emotional intelligence, and respect for authority. Discipline is positively enforced, and every learner is encouraged to take responsibility for their actions and to strive for personal excellence in both word and deed.

We would be honoured if you entrusted us with your child. Join the Fairways family and allow your son or daughter to experience a transformative journey marked by academic brilliance, personal growth, and a lifelong love for learning. Together, we can shape the leaders of tomorrow.
